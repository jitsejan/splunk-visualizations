2,"It has been said that Giotto was the first real painter, like Adam was the first man. We agree with the first part. Giotto continued the Byzantine style of Cimabue and other predecessors, but he earned the right to be included in gold letters in the history of painting when he added a quality unknown to date: emotion",1337,Giotto Di Bondone,1267,70
3,"For better or for worse, Leonardo will be forever known as the author of the most famous painting of all time, the ""Gioconda"" or ""Mona Lisa"". But he is more, much more. His humanist, almost scientific gaze, entered the art of the quattrocento and revoluted it with his sfumetto that nobody was ever able to imitate",1519,Leonardo Da Vinci,1452,67
4,"<em>""Cezanne is the father of us all.""</em> This famous quote has been attributed to both Picasso and Matisse, and certainly it does not matter who actually said it, because in either case would be appropriate. While he exhibited with the Impressionist painters, Cézanne left behind the whole group and developed a style of painting never seen so far, which opened the door for the arrival of Cubism and the rest of the vanguards of the twentieth century",1906,Paul CÉZanne,1839,67
5,"The fascinating use of the light and shadows in Rembrandt's works seem to reflect his own life, moving from fame to oblivion. Rembrandt is the great master of Dutch painting, and, along with Velázquez, the main figure of 17th century European Painting. He is, in addition, the great master of the self-portrait of all time, an artist who had never show mercy at the time of depicting himself",1669,Rembrandt Van Rijn,1606,63
6,"Along with Rembrandt, one of the summits of Baroque painting. But unlike the Dutch artist, the Sevillan painter spent most of his life in the comfortable but rigid courtesan society.

7,"Although the title of ""father of abstraction"" has been assigned to several artists, from Picasso to Turner, few painters could claim it with as much justice as Kandinsky. Many artists have succeeded in painting emotion, but very few have changed the way we understand art. Wassily Kandinsky is one of them.",1944,Wassily Kandinsky,1866,78
8,"The importance of Monet in the history of art is sometimes ""underrated"", as Art lovers tend to see only the overwhelming beauty that emanates from his canvases, ignoring the complex technique and composition of the work (a ""defect"" somehow caused by Monet himself, when he declared that <em>""I do not understand why everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love&quot;</em>",1926,Claude Monet,1840,86
9,"The tough and violent Caravaggio is considered the father of Baroque painting, with his spectacular use of lights and shadows. Caravaggio’s chiaroscuro became so famous that many painters started to copy his paintings, creating the 'Caravaggisti' style.",1610,Caravaggio,1571,39
10,"Turner is the best landscape painter of Western painting. Whereas he had been at his beginnings an academic painter, Turner was slowly but unstoppably evolving towards a free, atmospheric style, sometimes even outlining the abstraction, which was misunderstood and rejected by the same critics who had admired him for decades",1851,Joseph Mallord William Turner,1775,76
11,"Van Eyck is the colossal pillar on which rests the whole Flemish paintings from later centuries, the genius of accuracy, thoroughness and perspective, well above any other artist of his time, either Flemish or Italian.",1441,Jan Van Eyck,1390,51
12,"The real Leonardo da Vinci of Northern European Rennaisance was Albrecht Dürer, a restless and innovative genious, master of drawing and color.

13,"The major figure of American Abstract Expressionism, Pollock created his best works, his famous drips, between 1947 and 1950. After those fascinating years, comparable to Picasso’s blue period or van Gogh’s final months in Auvers, he abandoned the drip, and his latest works are often bold, unexciting works.",1956,Jackson Pollock,1912,44
14,"Some readers will be quite surprised to see the man who is, along with Picasso, the greatest artistic genius of all time, out of the ""top ten"" of this list, but the fact is that even Michelangelo defined himself as ""sculptor"", and even his painted masterpiece (the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel",1564,Michelangelo Buonarroti,1475,89
15,"One of the most fascinating figures in the history of painting, his works moved from Impressionism (soon abandoned",1903,Paul Gauguin,1848,55
16,"oya is an enigma. In the whole History of Art few figures are as complex as the artist born in Fuendetodos, Spain. Enterprising and indefinable, a painter with no rival in all his life, Goya was the painter of the Court and the painter of the people. He was a religious painter and a mystical painter. He was the author of the beauty and eroticism of the 'Maja desnuda' and the creator of the explicit horror of 'The Third of May, 1808'. He was an oil painter, a fresco painter, a sketcher and an engraver. And he never stopped his metamorphosis",1828,Francisco De Goya,1746,82
17,"Few names in the history of painting are now as famous as Van Gogh, despite the complete neglect he suffered in life. His works, strong and personal, are one of the greatest influences in the twentieth century painting, especially in German Expressionism",1890,Vincent Van Gogh,1853,37

20,"Art critics tend to regard Matisse as the greatest exponent of twentieth century painting, only surpassed by Picasso. This is an exaggeration, although the almost pure use of color in some of his works strongly influenced many of the following avant-gardes",1954,Henri Matisse,1869,85

24,"After the premature death of Giorgione, Titian became the leading figure of Venetian painting of his time.

His influence on later artists -Rubens, Velázquez...- is extremely important",1576,Titian,1476,100
25,"Along with Kandinsky and Malevich, Mondrian is the leading figure of early abstract painting.

26,"espite being one of the most important figures of the quattrocento, the Art of Piero della Francesca has been described as “cold”, “hieratic” or even “impersonal”. But with the apparition of Berenson and the great historians of his era, like Michel Hérubel -who defended the “metaphysical dimension” of the paintings by Piero-, his precise and detailed Art finally occupied the place that it deserves in the Art history",1492,Piero Della Francesca,1416,76
27,"Rubens was one of the most prolific painters of all time, thanks in part to the collaboration of his study. Very famous in life, he traveled around Europe to meet orders from very wealthy and important clients. His female nudes are still amazing in our days",1640,Peter Paul Rubens,1577,63
28,"Brilliant and controversial, Warhol is the leading figure of pop-art and one of the icons of contemporary art. His silkscreen series depicting icons of the mass-media (as a reinterpretation of Monet's series of Water lilies or the Rouen Cathedral",1987,Andy Warhol,1928,59
29,"Like most geniuses, Miro is an unclassificable artist. His interest in the world of the unconscious, those hidden in the depths of the mind, link him with Surrealism, but with a personal style, sometimes closer to Fauvism and Expressionism. His most important works are those from the series of ""Constellations"", created in the early 40s",1983,Joan MirÓ,1893,90

31,"Leading figure of realism, and a clear precedent for the impressionists, Courbet was one of the greatest revolutionaries, both as an artist and as a social-activist, of the history of painting. Like Rembrandt and other predecessors, Courbet did not seek to create beauty, but believed that beauty is achieved when and artist represents the purest reality without artifice",1877,Gustave Courbet,1819,58

37,"Half way between modernism and symbolism appears the figure of Gustav Klimt, who was also devoted to the industrial arts. His nearly abstract landscapes also make him a forerunner of geometric abstraction",1918,Gustav Klimt,1862,56

43,"Vermeer was the leading figure of the Delft School, and for sure one of the greatest landscape painters of all time.
